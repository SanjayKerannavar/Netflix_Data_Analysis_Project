"Using Excel, I cleaned the data and loaded it into Power BI. I then created DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures and developed various visualizations."

Netflix Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI & DAX

In this project, I analyzed Netflix Movies and TV Shows data using Power BI by cleaning and transforming the dataset in Excel and loading it into Power BI for visualization. I utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Runtime (Hrs), Total Content Count, Movies vs TV Shows, Average IMDB Rating, and Top 5 Genres. Advanced DAX functions such as SUM, COUNTROWS, CALCULATE, AVERAGE, and TOPN were implemented to derive insights. The dashboard features interactive slicers for filtering by Release Year, Title, and Genre, a geospatial map to analyze Netflix content distribution by country, and trend analysis of content released over the years. This project demonstrates my expertise in data visualization, storytelling, and interactive analytics using Power BI and DAX.
